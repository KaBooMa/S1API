# S1API Overview

Welcome to **S1API** — the official modding API for Schedule I.

S1API empowers modders to create custom quests, save/load their own data, hook into player/world/warehouse events, and build new gameplay systems — all without reverse-engineering the game themselves.

It brings **stability**, **expandability**, and **future-proofing** to Schedule I mods.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide a safe, stable platform for mod developers
- Simplify common modding tasks (saving data, tracking player state, adding quests)
- Hook into core gameplay events easily
- Keep mods working across Schedule I updates (Mono and Il2Cpp)
- Encourage an open and powerful modding community

## 🧩 Core Systems Provided by S1API

- **Save System** — Store your custom mod data separately from the vanilla game saves
- **Quest Manager** — Create, track, and complete new quests
- **Event System** — Subscribe to key game events without patching manually
- **Warehouse Manager** — Manage player properties dynamically
- **Utility Tools** — Safe reflection, type discovery, and centralized logging
